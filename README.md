# quick-pmd
A batch script to quickly compile PC-98 .MML file using PMDDotNet and play it on FMPlayer. With PMDDotNet and FMPlayer included you don't need to setup any DOS shenanigans.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo or [download it here](https://github.com/rzf45/quick-pmd/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the files anywhere you want.

## How to use
1. Place your .mml file inside `MML` folder
2. Open command prompt on the folder where the `mml.bat` is.
3. Type `mml YOUR_MML_FILENAME` without the extension.

    Example using `HSOBS1.MML` included in the MML folder:
    ```
    mml HSOBS1
    ```
